# Contributing to GED Structural Features

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! 🎉

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue with:
- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Python version, package versions)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for:
- New OT features to extract
- Additional benchmark datasets
- Performance optimizations
- Graph Neural Network implementations
- Documentation improvements

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Make your changes**:
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation
   - Follow existing code style
4. **Commit your changes**: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
5. **Push to branch**: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
6. **Open a Pull Request**

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Testing

Before submitting:
- Run existing experiments to ensure no regression
- Test on at least one benchmark dataset
- Verify figures generate correctly

### Documentation

Please update:
- README.md if adding major features
- Docstrings in code
- Examples if changing API

## Priority Areas

We're especially interested in contributions for:

1. **Graph Neural Networks** (20-25% expected improvement)
2. **Larger Graph Support** (50-100+ nodes)
3. **Additional Datasets** (chemistry, social networks, code)
4. **GPU Acceleration** (for large-scale experiments)
5. **Learned OT Features** (neural architecture search)
